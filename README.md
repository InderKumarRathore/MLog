MLog
====

MLog gives you more debugging information which you don't get with traditional NSLog, like method name, line number etc.


How to use it?
Use MLog/MDLog difference is, one prints date and time other doesn't
'D' in the MDLog represents that it prints date. The output is like
`<ReferceOfObject> -[ClassName methodName] [#LineNumber]| This is your message.`

MCLog is used for C functions which doesn't include self or you can use in blocks to aviod retained self

How to disable logs?
In release mode all logs are disabled but if you want to disable it in debug mode also then just comment the line where `ENABLE_M_LOGS` macro is defined
